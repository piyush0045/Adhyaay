        ADHYAAY is the annual literary-cum-cultural fest of HBTU. It is expected
        that ADHYAAY'23 will have 10,000+ footfalls and hence it will be larger
        than ever. A total of 3 days into Adhyaay will witness various events
        coming from all the sub-councils of HBTU. ADHYAAY brings the combined
        list of events from cultural, literary, hobby and photography
        sub-councils into one bracket
